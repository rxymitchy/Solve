## Installation

To run the solutions locally, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rxymitchy/solve.git
   cd solve
   ```

2. **Install Python**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Verify Python Installation**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages** (if any):
   If there are any additional packages required (e.g., for testing), you can create a `requirements.txt` file and install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each of the three tests has its own Python script. You can run them individually as follows:

1. **Minimum and Maximum Sum**:
   ```bash
   python min_max_sum.py
   ```

2. **Diagonal Difference**:
   ```bash
   python diagonal_difference.py
   ```

3. **Divisible Sum Pairs**:
   ```bash
   python divisible_sum_pairs.py
   ```

## Tests

### 1. Minimum and Maximum Sum
This function takes five positive integers as input and returns the minimum and maximum sums that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.

### 2. Diagonal Difference
This function takes a square matrix as input and returns the absolute difference between the sum of its diagonals.

### 3. Divisible Sum Pairs
This function takes an array of integers and a positive integer `k`, returning the number of pairs `(i,j)` where `i < j` and `ar[i] + ar[j]` is divisible by `k`.
